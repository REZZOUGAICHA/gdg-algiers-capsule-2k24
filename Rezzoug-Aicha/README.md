In my second year at ESI, I stepped into GDG Algiers as a communication member, 
and from that moment, everything changed. GDG became my anchor, making ESI feel 
a little lighter and a lot more exciting. It was the first club I visited, 
and instantly felt at home—huge shoutout to Sarra Bouzoul for her incredible welcome!

Over the past two years, I’ve gained invaluable experience, met incredible people, 
attended unforgettable events, and learned things that continue to shape my journey. 
And now, I have the honor of stepping up as one of this season’s communication co-managers.

Here’s to creating the best experiences yet! 

To every GDG member: keep nurturing this community, keep creating, keep making a difference and doing cool things that matter!
